Development
-----------
This rather custom-made .NET library was created with the intension of reusing large portions of the code for various software applications, such as [EasyFileManager](https://github.com/rafcolson/EasyFileManager), for which reason this library may grow over time.

Credit to *Microsoft* for allowing developers to create for free, with their *Visual Studio Community*. Also kudos to the contributors to the *Microsoft Windows API Code Pack* project for their updates, making it (more) compatible with newer *.NET* packages. Credit to the creator of *ExifTool* for allowing other developers to freely attain access to embedded metadata of videos. Especially praise to the *OpenStreetMap Foundation* for sharing their resources of the geographically mapped world, with the world. Without any of those parties *EasyFileManager* would not have been possible, not only in terms of time, but also in general, as I am not a professional programmer.

Usage
-----
In order to use this library, fork this repository, link one or more projects to your *Microsoft Visual Studio* solution and reference those in your project(s).

Release notes
-------------
See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/rafcolson/DotNetHelper/blob/main/CHANGELOG) for relevant changes. Watch out for compatibility issues that may arise over time.
